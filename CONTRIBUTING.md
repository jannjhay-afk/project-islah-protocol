Welcome to the **Imago Dei Movement**. We are not just writing code; we are building a conscience.

## Our Values
1.  **Kindness:** We debate ideas, not people.
2.  **Truth:** We prioritize structural integrity over convenient hacks.
3.  **Sovereignty:** We build for the user, not the corporation.

## How to Help (Pilot Phase)
We are currently focused on **Phase 0**. We need help with:
* **Rust:** Optimizing `sled` database writes for mobile ARM chips.
* **AI:** Testing Llama 3.2 3B prompts for "Constitutional Adherence" (preventing jailbreaks).
* **Security:** Auditing our ZK-proof implementation plans.

## Pull Request Process
1.  Fork the repo.
2.  Create a feature branch.
3.  Submit your PR with a clear description of the "Truth" you are adding.
